## Troubleshooting

### "Anki Not Found"
- Make sure Anki Desktop is open
- Verify AnkiConnect is installed: Tools → Add-ons → Check for "AnkiConnect"
- AnkiConnect uses port 8765 by default

### "0 Cards Added"
- The note type might have field mismatches
- Try deleting and recreating the note type in Anki
- Or use APKG export which creates fresh note types

### No content found
- Make sure you've generated a Quiz or Flashcards in Gemini Notebook first
- Refresh the page and try again
- Some notebooks may have different data structures

### Math not rendering
- Make sure MathJax is configured in Anki
- Cards use `\(...\)` for inline math and `\[...\]` for display math
